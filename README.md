# ICS4U - CPT: Data Interaction and Visualization

## Introduction
How happy are you? How happy do you think your friends are? Do you live in a happy community? What about your country? Well, the World Happiness Report has the answer! In all seriousness being happy is incredibly important to life and the mood of your community is sure to influence you or your close friends and family.

## Dataset Description
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the year 2019 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

## Inspiration
I decided to use this dataset because of how much I value the happiness of myself and others, I believe that even if one has all the money in the world but isn’t truly happy then there is no point in having that money. I was also interested in learning more about how we scientifically decide how we measure happiness as it isn’t something that can be easily measured. I wanted to get to know more about the state of the world and am even more curious about the World Happiness Report for 2020 as covid-19 and the lack of social interaction is sure to make an impact on whether people find themselves happy. I chose this dataset mostly due to my own curiosity.
